# ts-linted-template

This is the template that I use when starting new TS projects. It contains:

-   TypeScript
-   ESLint
-   Prettier
-   Automatic fix/format on save (using VSCode)

The ESLint rules are quite strict by default and are intended to enforce good (in my opinion!) practices along with consistent code styling.

I use this alongside vue-cli to create Vue projects.
